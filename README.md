This is the first Treehouse Project for the Full Stack Javascript course. 
It has an object array with quotes. There are two functions: one to select a random quote from the array, and then another to print that quote, with the year and citation if applicable. When the button on the page is clicked then the random quote using the printQuote function displays the random quote.
